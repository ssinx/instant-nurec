"""Branch-coverage tests for KelvinPrimitiveMerge._maybe_voxelize_static_layer.

The full ``merge_primitives_and_batch`` flow needs a fully-populated batch
+ rig trajectories which is exercised end-to-end by integration runs and
is out of scope for the unit tests; what's testable here is the
voxelization hook itself, which is the only behavior added by this
commit.
