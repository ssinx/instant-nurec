# InstantNuRec: Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Reconstruction from Driving Logs

[![Project Page](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Page-green)](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/instant-nurec/) [![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-Paper-b31b1b?logo=arxiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2607.14203) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache--2.0-orange)](LICENSE.txt) [![Model](https://img.shields.io/badge/HF-Model-yellow?logo=huggingface&style=flat-square)](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/instant-nurec) [![Data](https://img.shields.io/badge/NCore-0d9488?logo=database&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles-NCore)

NVIDIA InstantNuRec is a feed-forward neural reconstruction model for autonomous vehicle simulation that turns a multi-camera driving log into a fully simulatable 3D Gaussian scene in a single forward pass. It emits a Gaussian primitive per pixel covering geometry, appearance, and motion, renderable in real time, and its output can initialize downstream Omniverse NuRec training for higher fidelity.

## Announcements

- **July 2026:** The [InstantNuRec project page](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/instant-nurec/) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2607.14203) are now available.

## Abstract

3D simulation platforms are critical for autonomous driving because they enable end-to-end policy evaluation, thereby reducing development costs and improving safety. In recent years, neural simulation has become predominant, with methods such as NuRec playing a central role; however, these methods remain relatively slow and typically require per-scene tuning. In this work, we present Instant NuRec, a feed-forward neural reconstruction model that turns a multi-view driving log into a fully simulatable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) world in a single forward pass. The model accepts multi-view input from a calibrated camera rig and emits a layered output consisting of static and dynamic 3DGS layers, a sky cubemap, and per-camera ISP corrections, while providing native support for non-pinhole camera models via 3DGUT. It reconstructs a 10–20-second multi-camera scene in roughly 1.5 seconds and achieves a PSNR on the Waymo Open Dataset that is 2.01 dB above the strongest evaluated baseline. Instant NuRec is deeply integrated into NuRec and is compatible with AlpaSim for closed-loop simulation.

> **Repository scope:** This standalone CLI exports only the static scene
> Gaussians to PLY. The abstract above describes the complete research model.

## Pipeline Overview

This repo goes from ncorev4 ingest → frame batch prep → forward pass
→ 3D-Gaussian PLY export. The PLY output is usable directly as a
static reconstruction, and can also serve as initialization for
downstream NuRec training to reach higher fidelity.

Instant-NuRec and
[NuRec](https://docs.nvidia.com/nurec/nurec/reconstruct-av-scene.html)
share the same input (NCore V4 clip / HF dataset / sequence `.json`)
but run on different runtimes: Instant-NuRec is a native-Python
feed-forward preview (seconds per clip); NuRec is a Docker-based
per-scene refinement pipeline that produces a high-fidelity USDZ.

### Background

Instant NuRec is a feed-forward reconstruction model that converts
driving logs into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations. Its
vision-transformer backbone and DPT-decoders output a high-fidelity
3D environment that's ready for simulations.

Instant NuRec leverages the following foundational technologies:
[Depth-Anything-V3](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/depth-anything-3),
[STORM](https://github.com/NVlabs/GaussianSTORM), and
[BTimer](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/bullet-timer/).

## User Guide

<details>
<summary><b>Setup</b></summary>

#### Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.11
- **NVIDIA driver and GPU VRAM** — see the
  [NuRec Hardware Setup and Requirements](https://docs.nvidia.com/nurec/basics/hardware.html#hardware-setup-and-requirements)
  page; Instant-NuRec inherits the same minimums.
- **uv** — the [Astral Python package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
  Install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` or
  `pip install uv`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/instant-nurec.git
cd instant-nurec
./setup.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

`setup.sh` runs `uv sync --frozen`, which installs the locked dependency
tree from `uv.lock` into `.venv/`. The only CUDA dependency is whatever
the pinned `torch` wheel ships with.

This repo is native-Python only — no Docker required. If you want a
container, use the standard
[NuRec](https://docs.nvidia.com/nurec/nurec/reconstruct-av-scene.html)
image as a generic CUDA environment.

#### Download Model Checkpoints [optional]

> **Note:** The checkpoint selected by `--model` is auto-downloaded into
> the Hugging Face hub cache on the first inference run. PA-front remains
> the default.

However, you can also manually download the model into a directory of
your choice:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub[cli]
hf auth login
hf download nvidia/instant-nurec --local-dir checkpoints
```

This places the following files in `checkpoints/`:

    checkpoints/
    └── pth/
        ├── instant_nurec_pa_front_1.1.0.pth
        ├── instant_nurec_pa_multiview_1.1.0.pth
        └── instant_nurec_pq_road_1.0.0.pth

Point the pipeline at this local copy by exporting:

```bash
export INSTANT_NUREC_FULL_PT="$(pwd)/checkpoints/pth/instant_nurec_pa_front_1.1.0.pth"
```

When using a local override, make sure the file matches the `--model`
selection.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Inference</b></summary>

> **Note:** The selected pretrained weights are fetched on first inference
> from the Hugging Face repo `nvidia/instant-nurec` and cached locally;
> subsequent runs read them from the cache. Set `INSTANT_NUREC_FULL_PT`
> to a matching local checkpoint to override the auto-download.

The following inference profiles are available:

| model | description | default input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pa-front` | Front-camera profile. **Dense pixel-aligned** Gaussians. | 18 × `camera_front_wide_120fov`, 784×448 |
| `pa-multiview` | 1, 3, or 5 cameras. **Dense pixel-aligned** Gaussians. | 18 frames per camera across front-wide, cross-left, and cross-right, 504×280 (54 images total) |
| `pq-front` | Fixed front-wide camera. **Selective point-query** Gaussians (fewer outputs). | 18 × `camera_front_wide_120fov`, 784×448 |

##### First run — end-to-end on a public demo clip

The clip lives in a gated HF dataset. Accept the terms at
[nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles-NCore](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles-NCore)
while logged into Hugging Face, then `hf auth login` locally; the same
auth covers the `nvidia/instant-nurec` model auto-download on first run.

```bash
# Download the clip (~2 GB)
hf download \
    nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles-NCore --repo-type dataset \
    --include "clips/000da9de-0ee5-465a-9a2d-e7e91d3016bb/*" \
    --local-dir ./demo_clip

# Reconstruct it
python run_inference.py \
    --model pa-front \
    --ncore-path ./demo_clip/clips/000da9de-0ee5-465a-9a2d-e7e91d3016bb/pai_000da9de-0ee5-465a-9a2d-e7e91d3016bb.json \
    --output-dir ./demo_output \
    --merge
```

For the default `pa-front` command above, success looks like a single PLY at
`./demo_output/<run_id>/ply/pai_000da9de-.../pai_000da9de-....ply` —
~1.88 M Gaussians, kl-optimal voxelized from 2.87 M merged (3.18 M
pre-merge across 2 chunks) to land in `[0.9 * --n-gaussians,
--n-gaussians]` (default target 2 M). Omit `--merge` to write
per-chunk PLYs instead (voxelization is bundled with merge and
runs only when the flag is set).

To run another model on the same clip, select its profile, such as
`--model pa-multiview` or `--model pq-front`.

##### View your output

The PLY is a **3DGS** PLY (Gaussian Splatting), not a point cloud —
generic viewers like MeshLab / macOS Preview will fail to open it.
Use one of:

- [SuperSplat](https://playcanvas.com/supersplat/editor) — browser, no install.
- `ply_viewer` — shipped in the NuRec container.

`--ncore-path` accepts two input shapes:

##### Mode 1 — single sequence `.json` (NuRec-aligned)

The path is treated as one ncorev4 sequence metadata file.
This matches NuRec's own input convention.

```bash
./run.sh \
    --ncore-path /path/to/clips/<uuid>/pai_<uuid>.json \
    --output-dir /tmp/out
```

##### Mode 2 — `.lst` manifest (batch)

The path is treated as a list of sequence JSON paths, one per line.
Each line may be absolute, relative-to-the-LST-file's directory, or
`~/`-prefixed; lines starting with `#` and blank lines are skipped;
mixed absolute + relative entries in a single LST are supported.

```
# example_manifest.lst
/abs/path/to/clips/<uuid_a>/pai_<uuid_a>.json
relative/path/to/clips/<uuid_b>/pai_<uuid_b>.json
~/symlinked/clips/<uuid_c>/pai_<uuid_c>.json
```

```bash
./run.sh \
    --ncore-path /path/to/example_manifest.lst \
    --output-dir /tmp/out \
    --merge
```

`run.sh` validates the input + output paths and execs
`python run_inference.py`. You can also call the CLI directly:

```bash
python run_inference.py \
    --ncore-path /path/to/sequence.json \
    --output-dir /tmp/out
```

Output layout: PLYs only, under `out_dir/<run_id>/ply/<sequence_id>/...ply`.

##### Waymo Open Dataset through the official NCore converter

InstantNuRec does **not** parse Waymo TFRecords or the Waymo Open Dataset v2
Parquet component tables itself. Convert the original Waymo **`.tfrecord`**
sequences with NVIDIA NCore first, then pass the generated sequence metadata
JSON to `--ncore-path`. The converter owns the Waymo-to-NCore camera-axis,
extrinsics, timestamps, camera model, masks, and cuboid-label conversions.

The v2 Parquet tree at `camera_image/`, `camera_calibration/`, and
`vehicle_pose/` cannot be used as input to this official converter; obtain the
matching Waymo TFRecord release for conversion.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVIDIA/ncore.git
cd ncore

# Run from the NCore repository root. This writes one NCore V4 metadata JSON
# beside each converted sequence.
bazel run //tools/data_converter/waymo:convert -- \
    --root-dir /data/waymo/tfrecords/training \
    --output-dir /data/ncore/waymo/training \
    waymo-v4 --profile separate-sensors --world-global-mode localized
```

Then reconstruct a converted sequence. `--waymo-ncore` selects NCore's
official Waymo sensor IDs. For `pa-multiview`, the default is all five cameras:
front, front-left, front-right, side-left, side-right. This is important because
the release checkpoint's three-camera default uses 120-degree cameras, whereas
the converted Waymo camera IDs use the `_50fov` naming convention. The actual
projection always uses the TFRecord calibration converted to NCore intrinsics;
the sensor ID does not override or rescale a camera's physical field of view.

```bash
instant-nurec \
    --model pa-multiview \
    --waymo-ncore \
    --ncore-path /data/ncore/waymo/training/<sequence-metadata>.json \
    --output-dir ./waymo_output \
    --merge \
    --render-input-cameras
```

For one TFRecord, InstantNuRec can invoke the same official converter itself.
It stages only that file in a temporary directory, so neighboring segments are
not converted. This requires a local `NVIDIA/ncore` checkout and either
`bazel` or `bazelisk` available on `PATH`.

```bash
instant-nurec \
    --model pa-multiview \
    --waymo-tfrecord /data/datasets/waymo/waymo-open-dataset-v2.0.1/waymo-open-dataset-v1.4.3/testing/segment-17212025549630306883_2500_000_2520_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord \
    --ncore-repo /path/to/ncore \
    --waymo-conversion-dir /data/ncore/waymo/testing \
    --output-dir ./waymo_output \
    --merge \
    --render-input-cameras
```

The converted metadata is reused on later runs through a small mapping file in
`--waymo-conversion-dir`; this avoids relying on the TFRecord filename because
the official converter names output from Waymo's internal segment context ID.
Add `--force-waymo-conversion` to recreate it after changing the source
TFRecord or converter version.

The official Waymo converter stores cuboid tracks with NCore label source
`EXTERNAL`; the Waymo input path selects that source automatically. The output
PLY remains static-only, while the prediction log reports the static and
dynamic Gaussian counts for each chunk.

To restrict `pa-multiview` to three cameras for lower memory use, repeat
`--camera-id` in this exact order:

```bash
--camera-id camera_front_50fov \
--camera-id camera_front_left_50fov \
--camera-id camera_front_right_50fov \
--camera-id camera_side_left_50fov \
--camera-id camera_side_right_50fov
```

See the [NCore Waymo conversion guide](https://nvidia.github.io/ncore/conversions/waymo/waymo.html)
and [converter implementation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ncore/tree/main/tools/data_converter/waymo)
for Bazel prerequisites and supported converter options.

##### Render source camera views

For camera-pose and reconstruction-alignment checks, add
`--render-input-cameras`. The standalone renderer writes a PNG for every
input frame plus a side-by-side `input | render` comparison under
`out_dir/<run_id>/render/<sequence_id>/chunk_<N>/<camera>/`.

```bash
instant-nurec \
    --model pa-multiview \
    --waymo-ncore \
    --ncore-path /data/ncore/waymo/training/<sequence-metadata>.json \
    --output-dir ./waymo_output \
    --render-input-cameras
```

The renderer uses `gsplat` to project each Gaussian's learned anisotropic
covariance to a screen-space ellipse and alpha-composite it in depth order.
Install the renderer in the active environment before adding the flag:

```bash
proxy pip install gsplat==1.5.3
```

The official converter writes Waymo's OpenCV pinhole calibration after its
camera-frame conversion. The renderer currently renders the static layer;
dynamic layers and the sky cubemap are the next development steps.

#### CLI reference

| flag | default | purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--model` | `pa-front` | Input/checkpoint profile: `pa-front`, `pa-multiview`, or `pq-front`. |
| `--ncore-path` | one input required | A `.json` file (single sequence) or a `.lst` manifest (one JSON path per line). Mutually exclusive with `--waymo-tfrecord`. |
| `--waymo-ncore` | absent (false) | Select default sensor IDs emitted by NCore's official Waymo converter. `pa-multiview` uses all five cameras by default; pass `--camera-id` repeatedly to select one or three cameras instead. |
| `--waymo-tfrecord` | — | One `.tfrecord` segment to convert through the official NCore converter before prediction. Requires `--ncore-repo` and `--waymo-conversion-dir`; selects all five Waymo cameras for `pa-multiview` automatically. |
| `--ncore-repo` | — | Local `NVIDIA/ncore` source checkout used by the official Bazel conversion target. Only used with `--waymo-tfrecord`. |
| `--waymo-conversion-dir` | — | Persistent directory holding NCore V4 conversion output for `--waymo-tfrecord`. |
| `--force-waymo-conversion` | absent (false) | Recreate the NCore V4 output rather than reuse its metadata JSON. |
| `--output-dir` | (required) | Directory the pipeline writes PLYs into. |
| `--merge` | absent (false) | Boolean flag. When set, merges per-chunk primitives into a single frustum-ownership PLY per sequence (`<seq>.ply`) and runs kl-optimal voxelization (target count from `--n-gaussians`). Absent (default): per-chunk PLYs (`<seq>_chunk{N}.ply`), no voxelization. |
| `--n-gaussians` | `2000000` | Target number of static Gaussians after voxelization. Only consulted when `--merge` is set. The voxel size is searched iteratively via bracketed binary search to land the count in `[0.9 * target, target]`. |
| `--camera-id` | profile-dependent | Override a context camera. Repeat once per camera in canonical order. `pa-front` requires 1; `pa-multiview` supports 1, 3, or 5; `pq-front` is fixed to `camera_front_wide_120fov`. |
| `--max-chunks` | `8` | Maximum number of time-chunks processed per clip. One chunk spans up to 13.5 s, so the default covers 108 s. Longer clips are truncated and a `WARNING` logs the required value. |
| `--render-input-cameras` | absent (false) | Render every source camera frame with the `gsplat` CUDA 3DGS rasterizer and write an input/render comparison. Output is under `out_dir/<run_id>/render/`. |
| `--log-level` | `INFO` | `DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARNING` / `ERROR` / `CRITICAL`. |

#### Environment variables

| variable | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `INSTANT_NUREC_FULL_PT` | Absolute path to a local weights-only checkpoint matching `--model`. Takes priority over the auto-downloaded copy. |
| `INSTANT_NUREC_RUN_ID` | Override the per-run shortuuid; useful when scripting reproducible output paths. |
